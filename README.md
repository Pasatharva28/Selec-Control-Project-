# Selec-Control-Project-
A line follower bot is as the name suggests a bot that follows a line. Now this line can be either a dark one on a white surface or a white line on a black background, in our case, it is a black line with white background. Although it can be programmed to do vice versa. So once you switch the bot ON, it will follow the path you create using the line. We are going to achieve this objective by making use of sensors and motors for locomotion and in order to control the speed and direction of a motor driver as well and the last the main control of the whole system we need an MSP430G2553 Microcontroller. The sensor we are using is an Infrared Sensor (IR Sensor), the fundamental concept of light is every color absorbs a different wavelength of infrared or light and reflects back but black absorbs the whole light we make use of this concept to actuate the motors and decide their direction and speed of rotation to develop a line follower.
